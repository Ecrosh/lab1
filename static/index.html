	<p> Hi, I'm Edward. My major is Computer Science and I am a third year transfer student at UCSD. I came from San Francisco and my hobbies include cooking and playing basketball. I tutor for CSE 8A, 12 and 15L. The classes I am currently taking are CSE 120, CSE 112 and CSE 170 and I plan to graduate in Fall 2016. </p>
